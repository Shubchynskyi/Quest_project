I'll return for help.\n8< Hold my sword, I'm going in...\n\n4: You see Kikimora swamped over a laptop. What now?\n1< Kikimora? Laptop? What kind of mushrooms did I eat... Run away...\n5< Shout: Hey, back off from the laptop, let me show you some skills...\n6< Looks like you need a laptop to become a developer.
