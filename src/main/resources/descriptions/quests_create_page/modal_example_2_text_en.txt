1: You are standing in front of a magical stone with inscriptions. What will you choose?
2< go left – enter a fairytale
3< go right – meet your death
4< go straight – find a job

2: You see a closed chest. What will you do?
1< Who knows what's inside, I'll just go back...
7< I'm not afraid of anything, I'll open it...

3: You see a mysterious cave. What will you do?
1< Forget it, it's too scary. I'll go back for reinforcements.
8< Hold me back! I'm drawing my sword and stepping into the cave...

4: You see a Frost Witch, typing something passionately on a laptop. What will you do next?
1< A witch? A laptop? What kind of mushrooms did I eat... Running away...
5< Hey you! Step away from the laptop, let me show you how it’s done!
6< Seems like you can't get a job without a laptop. I hit the Witch with a stick and secure my future.

5: The Witch jumped into the swamp, taking the laptop with her, but to the right, you see a tunnel.
3< I'll go there, there's nothing else to do...

6: A true act of a real hero. Now I just need to find a job, and everything will be fine.
9< Wait, I still need some books... I'll search for them; there's a path with a sign saying "to the library".
10< Yes, exactly. Time to revise, learn, and look for a job. Games are evil.

7: Wow. There it is, a huge pile of gold.
11< Yay! Filling my pockets...
2< Something feels off, I'm closing this chest...

8: You step into the cave and see a Witch, a Troll, and a Dragon watching YouTube videos. What will you do?
12< Obviously! To battle!!!

9: A strange road lies ahead, leading backward. Or is it just me?
1< Nothing else to do, I’ll move forward...

10+: Hooray! It's a victory! But it's time to find a job and stop wasting time.
11- And then some vicious bandits came and killed you. Greed leads to no good. Defeat.
12- And so the tale ends. A horrible death in an unfair fight. Defeat.
