1: You are in front of a magical stone with inscriptions on it. What will you choose?
2< Go left - enter a fairytale
3< Go right - meet your death
4< Go straight - become a developer

2: You see a locked chest, now what...
1< Maybe I should turn back...
7< I'm not afraid of anything, I'll open it...

3: You see a cave, what will you do?
1< No way, I'm scared. I'll return for help.
8< Hold my sword, I'm going in...

4: You see Kikimora swamped over a laptop. What now?
1< Kikimora? Laptop? What kind of mushrooms did I eat... Run away...
5< Shout: Hey, back off from the laptop, let me show you some skills...
6< Looks like you need a laptop to become a developer. Hit Kikimora with a club and secure your future.

5: Kikimora jumped into the swamp, but to the right, you see a tunnel.
3< Alright, I'll head that way...

6: That's the real deed of a real programmer.
9< Wait, I still need literature... there's a path marked 'library'.
10< Yes, time to study Java and get coding. Games are evil.

7: Wow, a big pile of gold.
11< Hooray, let's fill our pockets...
2< Something's wrong here, I'll close the chest.

8: You enter the cave and see Koschei, Baba Yaga, and the Gorynych dragon watching YouTube.
12< Attack!!!

9: Strange road, it seems to lead back...
1< Nothing to do, keep going...

10+ Victory! But now it's time to really code. Enough fooling around.
11- Greed doesn't lead to good. The Pechenegs killed you.
12- And that's the end of the tale. Horrible death in an unfair fight. Defeat.
